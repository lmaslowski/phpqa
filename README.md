## Running tools

Pull the image:

```bash
docker pull jakzal/phpqa
```

The default command will list available tools:

```bash
docker run -it --rm jakzal/phpqa
```

To run the selected tool inside the container, you'll need to mount
the project directory on the container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/project -w /project jakzal/phpqa phpstan analyse src
```

You'll probably want to tweak this command for your needs and create an alias for convenience:

```bash
alias phpqa="docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/project -w /project jakzal/phpqa:alpine"
```

Add it to your `~/.bashrc` so it's defined every time you start a new terminal session.

Now the command becomes a lot simpler:

```bash
phpqa phpstan analyse src
```

## Building the image

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jakzal/phpqa.git
cd phpqa
make build
```

To build the alpine version:

```
make build-alpine
```

## Customising the image

It's often needed to customise the image with project specific extensions.
To achieve that simply create a new image based on `jakzal/phpqa`:

```
FROM jakzal/phpqa:alpine

RUN apk add --no-cache libxml2-dev \
 && docker-php-ext-install soap
```

Next, build it:

```
docker build -t foo/phpqa .
```

Finally, use your customised image instead of the default one:

```
docker run -it --rm -v $(pwd):/project -w /project foo/phpqa phpmetrics .
```
